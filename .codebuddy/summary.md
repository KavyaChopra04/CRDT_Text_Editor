 end# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is developed in C++ and focuses on implementing a logical clock system through the `LClock` class. The primary purpose of the project is to manage and process time events, allowing for the accumulation and advancement of time based on events from multiple logical clocks.

## Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Language**: C++
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures like `map` and `string`.

## Purpose of the Project
The project aims to provide a framework for managing logical clocks, which are essential in distributed systems to order events. The `LClock` class allows for processing time values, accumulating time across events, and advancing the clock based on interactions with other logical clocks.

## Build and Configuration Files
The project does not explicitly mention any build or configuration files in the provided directory structure. However, typical files that could be relevant in a standard C++ project include:
- `Makefile` (not present in the current structure)
- `CMakeLists.txt` (not present in the current structure)

As such, no specific build or configuration files can be listed from the provided structure.

## Source Files Location
The source files can be found in the following directory:
- `/Backend/src/`

### Source Files:
- `/Backend/src/lclock.cpp`

## Documentation Files Location
The project does not specify any documentation files in the provided directory structure. Documentation files, if present, would typically be located in a `docs` directory or similar, but no such directory is mentioned here.

### Summary of Documented Files:
- No documentation files found in the current structure.
